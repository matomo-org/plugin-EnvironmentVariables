# Matomo EnvironmentVariables Plugin

## Description

Override any Matomo config with environment variables. To overwrite any setting simply specify an environment variable in the following format:

```
MATOMO_$CATEGORY_$SETTING
```

For example to overwrite the database username and password which is usually defined in the `config/config.ini.php` like this:

```ini
[database]
username = "root"
password = "secure"
```

using environment variables like this:

```bash
export MATOMO_DATABASE_USERNAME=root
export MATOMO_DATABASE_PASSWORD=secure
```

### Known issues:
* Configuration arrays are currently not supported, for example you cannot define which `Plugins[]` should be loaded.
* At some point your Matomo may save/write the config file, for example when changing certain settings through the UI such as the trusted hosts. In this case, the currently read environment variables will be saved in the config file.
* If this plugin is used with PHP-FPM, for example in combination with NGINX, PHP-FPM will not have access to the environment variables by default. The pool used by PHP-FPM must either explicit define which ENVs should be exposed, or set `clear_env = no` in `/etc/php7/php-fpm.f/<pool>.conf`.
* When using containerisation and defining the database credentials as environment variables, you may have to hard code the configs indicating that this plugin is activated, something like the following:
```
[PluginsInstalled]
PluginsInstalled[] = "EnvironmentVariables"

[Plugins]
Plugins[] = "EnvironmentVariables"
```
Another option is to use the following console commands during the deployment process:
```
./console config:set 'Plugins.Plugins[]="EnvironmentVariables"'
./console config:set 'PluginsInstalled.PluginsInstalled[]="EnvironmentVariables"'
```
